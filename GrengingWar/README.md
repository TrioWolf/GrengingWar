# Grenging War

## About

This is a small time strategy game in the middle of being made. This game is about recreating a game I love to play yet the dev for it has basically abandoned the game. So I am creating a replica of the game in a way. Though with this I intend to add more content and develop it way more then the game this is heavily bassed off of. 

## Development

### Notes
- this is being figured out on the spot. No pre plan or design in mind.
- I am typically a solo Dev though I am trying to bring in other devs into the project
- I am building the structure of this development for what works for me. 
- If you are lucky enough to read this never feel shy about talking to me about changing a format or ask why I have chosen the way I have.


### Development Directions
- npc spawn system 
- res gathing system 
- crafting system 
- movement system (map and actual movement)
- attacking system 
- defencive system 
- chat system (late development)
- gear and item creation (building the armada of gear stats and all that fun stuff)

### Development Directions NOTES
- some things have been worked on a bit others have not been worked on at all 

### Task Notes 
- Logging the notes in a "change log" file 
- If you are a new dev to the team use the format below to create you a "change log/ task achievement log"
