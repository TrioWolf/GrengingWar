The "web" folder includes a demo starter app, which just shows the fundamentals of setting up a server. Use this folder material as a quick reference.

## Available Scripts

In the demo project directory (not the web directory), you can run:

### `npm dev-web`

 ...to spin up the Node-Setup backend API and the mock web front end
