## Topic -  Project Planning
What I have learned and find very useful for me is that I am usually scatter brained to get task done. With the ability to pre-plan and work out what needs to be done. I can focuse on perticular task and not jump from thing to thing while I am working. Breaking down all the components and the functionality code goals is really helping to figure out some of the possible hiccups that I will run into if I did them in random order.

## Sub-Topic 1 - Dialog 
This was a really usefull peice of research as for the design of my project is a game. In that I need to formulate a way to make a tutorial. This will help me in progressing to achieve that when the time comes . Also, a small bit of information that is obvious to me but not always to others is the use of how often you trigger these modals dialogs. In doing so you stop the user from continuing till they accomplish the goal at hand. This is what I will be using to make a tutorial base. Though, it is about not being over kill in making them to get the points across and finding out what key information needs to go into the dialogs before putting them together.  

* 1 How often you use the dialogs 
* 2 dont clutter to much into the dialogs
* 3 Be clear and concise
