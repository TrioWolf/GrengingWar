## Topic - Graphics and design

So What I Have been going through is great number of artistic and graphical design. Figuring out a style tile has been a interesting loop of work. As I work on one thing it then affects other things and constantly causing changes to happen. Though in the project that is the love of the art being created. Nothing is directly set in stone untill its fully been designed. Style tiles are helping me to stay more on track to the details that need to be completed.

## Sub-Topic 1 - How much does a image need to change to be considered your own artwork?
this was a useful link on the research of this question
- [quora.com](https://www.quora.com/How-much-do-I-need-to-edit-a-copyrighted-image-to-legally-use-it)

- [gerbenlaw.com](https://www.gerbenlaw.com/blog/the-30-percent-rule-in-copyright-law/)

so far this research is not answering the question I have but it is great information about copyright ownership and the do and donts.

yet again another great resource towards the question but still no resolve

- [copyright.gov](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html)

Well, I am back from doing research on this question. I have no resolve still to this exact question. Though, I am using royalty free website for the images. I still lay in doubt to how royalty free these images are. So, my question is still valid.
