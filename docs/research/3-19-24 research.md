## Topic - Google Login

<br>
Google Login is a service that Google provides that makes it easy to login and reduces the amount of work for the developer. I chose to use this service Google provides because I needed a simple login service that I can trust and can save me time as the developer. I find this tool to be easy to set up and run, with the flexability that lets you have the security you can count on and customization you need.
