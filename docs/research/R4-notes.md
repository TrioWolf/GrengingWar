## Topic - CSS modules

 [cssmodules why](https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/)

CSS Modules are a technique for managing and scoping styles in web development. In this approach, CSS class names and animation names are locally scoped by default, ensuring that they only apply to specific components or elements. This scoping is achieved during the build step using tools like Webpack or Browserify, where class names and selectors are transformed into unique strings, separating them from the global CSS scope. This approach offers several advantages, including improved code organization, reduced global scope issues, and the ability to create specific style dependencies for components. Additionally, CSS Modules promote better organization, preventing the need for global styles and making it easier to manage and understand your codebase.

### key take away

* CSS Modules are a build-time technique that scopes CSS class names and selectors locally by default, ensuring styles only affect specific components.
* This approach mitigates the issues related to global CSS scope, leading to better code organization and predictability.
* CSS Modules facilitate the creation of true style dependencies for components and promote a more structured and maintainable approach to styling in web development.

## Sub-Topic 1 - Thinking in React

[thinking in react](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)

Thinking in React involves breaking down the design into components, describing their visual states, and connecting them to allow data flow. React promotes this approach, and in building a searchable product data table, you start with a mockup and JSON API. The following takeaways are essential in understanding this thought process

* Component-Based Thinking: React encourages the breakdown of user interfaces into components, each responsible for a specific part of the application. Components facilitate reusability and maintainability, and it's crucial to identify and arrange them in a hierarchy.
* Static Version First: Building a static version of the app without interactivity is a wise starting point. Components render the UI from the data model using props, and this one-way data flow ensures a clear structure.
* State Management: To introduce interactivity, identify the minimal representation of UI state. Use state in the component that should control and update this state. Pass data via props to child components for rendering and add event handlers to handle user interactions, updating the state accordingly.
