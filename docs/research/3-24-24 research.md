## Topic - Database and API Structure and Architecture

This week has been crazy in the nature of database and API structure and architecture. I was using old code from about 6months ago or older. I managed to get it worked out that the code structure and architecture is not valid with current practice. In that I have spent alot of time using my favorite tool ChatGPT to sort this out and with it being a great tool it also has it failures with being up-to-date on everything. ChatGPT failed to call out I could be using old practises. This took having the light buld click on with a deprication warning. I then followed up on this deprication warning to realize the format and structure I had been using was almost 3 top teir updates old. I had to go back to documentation of mongodb and and Mongoose. The packages that I was using to work with the database. to realize that Mongoose set up was actually outdated, in which I took the route using strictly just mongoDB package and its structure. I did not do enough research to find out if Mongoose is outdated for what I was trying to do or not. Though I found a much simpler way to do it with just MongoDB package and using there client structure to make everything work. The following links are to the Mongoose and MongoDB documentation that made me realize just how outdated my structure and architecture was.

## Reference Links

**MongoDB**  
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/node-connect-mongodb/): This is MongoDB database connection documentation that provided me the resources to get up and running  

**Mongoose**    
[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#:~:text=You%20can%20connect%20to%20MongoDB,127.0.0.1%20instead%20of%20localhost%20.): I have no idea how recent there updates are. As stated above, I did not do much research into Mongoose. Though I was using packages from 3.0.0 and I currently see 8.2.3
