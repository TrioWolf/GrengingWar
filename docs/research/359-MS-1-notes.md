## Topic - Change over

What is a Change Over? a change over is what I like to say is the re-descovery. It is the time where you have been working on a project for a while or starting back up on a project. Like in my case I am re opening the project from about 6months back and have not looked at it at all since the last time I opened the project. Change over or re-descovery is where you are picking up the concepts and peices of the task and realize there is a better way of doing the task. In this it shows you that the project scope and time scale also changes with this in a projects projected time scale.

## Sub-Topic  - API
Questions: 
How to set up a custom API?
How to use a custom API in your own project?
How to run the API outside of the project?

* Because I have not worked with servers and API's in a while. I had to research and find out that I had to run this api on its own server
* I also needed express and axious for client and server side
* I used chat GPT to spin up a basic API service for me. I then took that and started customizing it to get the results that I wanted. In that I now how a basic API set up to use for me resource and npc information. I also noted that I might be able to just run the server and API off the same file. Still not 100% if that would be the right move or not for the scope and goal.
