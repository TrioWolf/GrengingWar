## Topic - Work Flow

In my research and working the using a good workflow I have found that it makes the entire process so much easier to maintain. Before the current work flow I was doing documentation and everything all at one time in to large of a chunk. Now that I have started doing it in smaller chunks peice by peice the work is alot smoother. ALong, with the greatness of others being able to check into the work I have been doing and not having to constantly ask me what this or that is.

## Sub-Topic 1 - useEffect function in React
I have been working on a way to impliment multiple timers. In doing so I have run into this issue of timers overlapping or using the wrong timer. The resolve that I have found to get this to work correctly is as the following.

* Using multiple components to accomplish the task with each having there own useEffect function in them with the timer to that perticular task.
* The resolve in doing that also helps in organization of code and components to do said task that is being worked on.

## Sub-Topic 2 - How to effectivly refactor code
this is something that is going to greatly help me in figuring out how to factor out over 1500+ lines of code that I manged to reduce down to roughly 100 lines in one component and in a second component roughly  100-150 lines of code.

in refactoring the code. There is 1 major issue that I run into. Deleting to many " (), {}" and I have found that there are a few tools that I use regularly that help me resolve this issue.

* chatgpt - probably the quickest and most efficent 
* Prettier code formatting -extension vscode- - it will help with organization of code lines and output
* the last part looks implimented and into vscode now - brackets was another extension I was using to color the brackers to have a more defined bracket breack down.
