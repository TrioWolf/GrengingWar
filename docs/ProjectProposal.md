## Problem Statement

The biggest issue I am seeing the area of games that this is reflecting off of is that the content is often to much for a user to really get into. Graphics and all the fancy stuff is great and all though, I am working towards bring back the simple life. Basic buttons and functionality. The Game is reflecting off 2 main games that I personally love and have played for over a decade. The Infinite Black(last looked dev took the orginal version off the stores) and Runescape. Runescape being a Iconic game in the MMORPG world. I find there is a bit more in simplicity they could do to keep it where I feel the game should stay. I am going to be implimenting the concept they have used to level up your account and get access to doing more content that way. My issue with games of MMORPG nature is that everything forces you into doing a quest. There are alot of people in the gaming world that hate that about MMORPG games that I want to try to provide that in my own design.

## Pain Points

### Pay to Win (p2w) in Free to Play (F2P)
p2w set ups often make a games community very small as only people with money can manage to get anywhere. That concept in combination to the F2P games kills the game. 

I dont have any research on this besides my own experience in playing games. Its a sad fact that so many great games are killed by the greed of developers and the companies that make these astounding games.


## Solution Statement


I am going to be resolving this issue by finding other routes of getting finacial support from other methods. 
such as labled 
- skins 
- limited edition content (for people around during the release of content)
- special currency buys (small transactions)
- packages to offer a variety of things in one purchase
- donation 

## Competition

- Warframe
- RuneScape 
- The Infinit Black

Those are all games that utalize different aspects of what I would like to make into a single build. Warframe focuses on the ability to customize your character. RuneScape has the micro-transactions for buying ingame content. The Infinite Black is another Micro-transaction game but only to 1 currency due to its design.


## Features & Functionality

Define key features and functionality intended to provide solutions to specific problems and pain points you have identified. These key items should be specifically defined in response to problems / pain points.

A good way to identify a Key Feature is to use the phrase 'In order to [solve this problem] I need to [do this]'. For example, 'In order to listen to music while I workout I need to be able to create a playlist'.

Features and functionality should be prioritized based on their importance to the user. This will help you focus on the most important features first and then add additional features as time allows.

The features that I want to add that fixes P2W problems is that I am going to add a market for things to be purchased. though, I will make this market set up where it can help you for a said duration. A example, you are grinding experience (xp). You can buy a booster for x amount of time. With the limitation to this being that you can only use that so often. It is also a item that is obtainable in-game but is considered very rare.


## Integrations


Login API working with google authentication. 

In the future I also intend to have a API that you can use to research and understand the resource or enemy of interest. This API would have the ability to be intergrated into Discord and websites for easy and fast customization of the prefered content.

I also intend to in the future to add something like Stripe to this for transactions. to support the game and the player base to be able to purchase content for the game. Most likely will be for micro transactions.
