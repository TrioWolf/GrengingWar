# Tech Stack


I am using the MERN stack

the tools are as follows:
- React 
- Express
- MongoDB
- Node. js

The purpose of this stack is react will help me build things in components to work with a more organized structure. Express will help me link all the data that is going to be made through out the development of content. MongoDB will help me store and save all the data that is already made and going to be made by the user.


## Application Design

I have No UI tools for this Though my design is built with a tab nature. Click/tap one thing to open the next area. 



## Front End Framework

 

I am using React to develop all the front end visual components and functionality.


## State Management

   

State management is going to using local state of React and MongoDB down the road.


## Node

 

I am using Node with NPM and NPX support


## Express



Express will be used to call data to the project to make functionality work in detail. While also storing user profiles and data on every bit of content.


## MongoDB



MongoDB is going my data storage in the long run. It will house every item in the game and all the data on each thing. It will also hold the data for the player base and there stats.
