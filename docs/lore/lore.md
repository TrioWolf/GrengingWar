## Lore 

Here we are humans that have ventured out into space to crash land on a planet. What is this plant? We ask ouselves... In the case of this situation, we landed in a pretty quiet place on this planet and seems to be nothing going on about the place. We already traveled around to find out there is enough to sustain us Humans on this planet and rebuild *we silently shout and party in our heads*. Though, we still have to figure out how to get our self back to our proper standards of being able to travel space. So here we begin our journey to gather and build and repair the craft we crash landed. 

After some great time traveling and exploring we realize there are countless species and factions on this planet in a warring way to dominate the planet. We think to our selves what is the best way to get by on this situation. Could we join or become part of the factions around and what is creating the riviting war at hand. 

(player explores and learns the limitations of the factions )
